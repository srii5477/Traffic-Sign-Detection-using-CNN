## Traffic Sign Detection Project using Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks ##

=> In this project, we have trained a CNN model using Keras to accurately detect and classify an input image containing a traffic sign. The model is robust to image variations, having been trained on data that was augmented and also generalizes fairly well as we have employed Dropout and Batch Normalization as our methods of choice to prevent overfitting. The frontend was created using Streamlit- an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science.
